# News - MangroveDB

In this study, we present a user-friendly database called the MangroveDB, an online resource that builds upon 651 RNA-seq, 69 microarray, and 53 WGS omics data. We collected 13 mangrove plant genomes with gene annotations and reconstructed gene models for 40 mangrove plant genomes without gene annotations. MangroveDB not only provided query functions about genes annotation, but also provided some visualization functions for analysis results, such as volcano plot, heatmap, PCA plot, bubble plot, and trend plot etc. We have prepared some examples of how to use MangroveDB in real‐world omics datasets from plants, such as differential expression, cross-species expression, tissue-specific expression, gene co-expression, time-series expression, GO and KEGG enrichment, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL), genome-wide association studies (GWAS). 

The MangroveDB is building. 2023-10-24

## [Welcome to MangroveDB](https://jasonxu.shinyapps.io/MangroveDB/)

MangroveDB offers browser, analysis and visualization functions to accelerate the investigation of molecular adaptation to intertidal environments in mangrove plants.
