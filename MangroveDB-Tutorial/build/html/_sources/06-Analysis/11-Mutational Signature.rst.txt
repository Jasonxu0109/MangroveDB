Mutational Signature
==========================
This tool provides visualization of mutational signature.
The concept of mutational signatures was introduced in 2012 following the demonstration that analysis of all substitution mutations in a set of 21 whole-genome-sequenced (WGS) breast cancers
could reveal consistent patterns of mutagenesis across tumours.
The mutation rates also vary with the trinucleotide context (i.e., the nucleotide of the mutated site along with the nucleotides of neighboring base pairs) of each site in plants.

------------------		
Users need to prepare one files, trinucleotide context counts.

**Trinucleotide context counts:** The data must contain Type, Trinucleotide, and Number columns.
Colnames must be Type, Trinucleotide, and Number. Data from excel (format: xlsx).

**Input example data:** `Trinucleotide context counts <https://github.com/Jasonxu0109/MangroveDB/releases/download/Example/96context_counts.xlsx>`_.
